## July 11: Excitement and Exploration
We just came to github HQ. We explored the place it was awesome. Lots of snacks and cool working spaces. Excited to spend the next few nights here for the hackathon!


## July 11: Research and Ideas
We came up with ideas. One of our frist ideas was making drone that acted like a hat. Something like this
<img width="350" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77c9b01a-8813-46fd-91eb-fe02d6ac5636" />
Except it would actually fly. 

then we narrowed down our ideas to something like the mark rober hat.

We liked this idea and thought we shud keep thinking before we finalized.

Then we thought of making a four leg spider in order to have something cool. We wanted people to walk past our project and be like thats cool as f***. So evertually we decided to make something like this.

to make it even more cool we decide to add a nerf gon on the top.
