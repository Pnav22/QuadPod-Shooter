# QuadPod Build Log

## July 11: Excitement and Exploration

We just arrived at GitHub HQ. The place is awesome—lots of snacks and cool working spaces! We're super excited to spend the next few nights here for the hackathon.

## July 11: Research and Ideas

We began brainstorming ideas. One of our first concepts was a drone that acted like a hat—something like this:

Except this one would actually fly.

Then we narrowed our ideas down to something similar to the Mark Rober hat:

We liked this concept but decided to keep thinking before finalizing.

Eventually, we settled on building a four-legged spider bot—something that would make people walk by and say, *"That's cool as f***."* So we decided to build something like this:

To make it even cooler, we decided to mount a Nerf gun on top.

## July 11–12: Getting Started

We started the CAD work and got some basic designs going:

We sent the parts out to get printed. One of our biggest mistakes was spending too much time CADing without grabbing parts early. By the time we went to get motors, most of the ones we needed were gone—we were two short.

We decided to redo the CAD to work with the motors that were still available. Shoutout to Alex for coming in clutch and giving us two extra motors from a workshop!

## July 12: Setting Up the ESP32

Pranav stayed up all night (July 11–12) trying to get the ESP32 to work. He wanted to start coding but realized the board wasn't responding.

He tried multiple computers and different ESP32s, only to find out hours later that the USB wires he used didn’t support data transfer. A whole all-nighter wasted.

## July 12: Finalizing the CAD

We finalized the CAD and started printing and assembling.

We used the screws from the servo motor kits to assemble everything.

## July 13: Assembly

We assembled the entire bot! Here are some photos:

## July 13: Coding!

We’re currently deep into coding! Stay tuned.
